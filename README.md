# Module 8
Summarize the project and what problem it was solving:
  For this project I had to create a clock that allowed the user to add seconds, minutes, or hours to the clock and it displayed it in 12 hour format and 24 hour format. 
What did you do particularly well?
  I thought that I added efficient comments throughout the code and I had well formatted code to make it easy to read and understand.
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure and so on?
  I feel that I could add more try catch blocks throughout the code to make sure there is no errors in the code that would make it crash. To make it more secure I would    
  probably limit access to certain things or split the code into various files.
Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, how did you overcome this?
  I found that making sure the clocks were in sync and making sure that they would reset and change the AM:PM at the right time was the most challenging. To overcome this I had 
  help from my cousin to show me examples in different programs that he has written to help me brainstorm other ways to fix mine. 
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  I added a lot of comments explaining what each block of code did and kept everything spaced evenly to make sure it was easy on the eyes.
